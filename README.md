I just wanted a very simple way to queue up video clips using MIDI messages sent from the Akai MPC Live II.

**Instructions**

1. put your MP4s in the `videos` folder.
2. list the clips and their stop/start note numbers in `data/clips.csv`
3. connect your sequencer/keyboard to the laptop via a MIDI interface
4. start playing your MIDI notes and the videos will play on the laptop
